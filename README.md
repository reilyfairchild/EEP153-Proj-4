# EEP153-Proj-4
We are Team David Zilberman

Topic & Goals:

Our project delves into the nutritional analysis for Malawi, looking at their staple food and understanding their specific nutritional challenges. Then, we aim to alleviate these challenges by analysing policy measures, specifically:

Cash Transfers: Compare the existing long-term SCTP (Social Cash Transfer Program) with our analysis.

GMO Maize: Understand the impact of Maize and potentially fortify it with additional nutrients.

Project Structure
Nutritional_Analysis.ipynb contains analysis for:

•Determining the Most Consumed Foods

•Nutritional Adequacy of Diet: Determining Which Nutrients Are Lacking

•Nutritional Analysis: Looking at the Most-Deficient Nutrients

•How can we increase these most limited nutrients by increasing the consumption of existing foods? Which foods are consumed the most to fortify?

•Determine fortification for maize-rich foods

📁 Data Files
All CSV files used in our analysis, including raw and cleaned datasets.

📁 Nutrient Data
Includes saved nutrient dataframes generated from our analysis for each year of data. These were used to assess dietary quality and nutritional trends over time.

📁 RGSN Files
Stores regression-ready data for each year, used in our statistical modeling and demand estimation analysis
