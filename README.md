# EEP153-Proj-4
We are Team David Zilberman

Topic & Goals:

Our project delves into the nutritional analysis for Malawi, looking at their staple food and understanding their specific nutritional challenges. Then, we aim to alleviate these challenges by analysing policy measures, specifically:

Cash Transfers : Compare existing long term SCTP (Social Cash Transfer Program) with our analysis.

GMO Maize: Understand the impact of Maize and potentially fortifying it with additional nutrients.
